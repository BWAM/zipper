\usage{
read_zip(.zip_path, .col_names = TRUE, .col_types = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.zip_path}{a file path to a zip file.}

\item{.col_names}{argument passed to vroom::vroom. "Either TRUE, FALSE or a
character vector of column names. If TRUE, the first row of the input will
be used as the column names, and will not be included in the data frame. If
FALSE, column names will be generated automatically: X1, X2, X3 etc. If
col_names is a character vector, the values will be used as the names of
the columns, and the first row of the input will be read into the first row
of the output data frame. Missing (NA) column names will generate a
warning, and be filled in with dummy names X1, X2 etc. Duplicate column
names will generate a warning and be made unique with a numeric prefix."}

\item{.col_types}{argument passed to vroom::vroom. "One of NULL, a cols()
specification, or a string. See vignette("readr") for more details. If
NULL, all column types will be imputed from the first 1000 rows on the
input. This is convenient (and fast), but not robust. If the imputation
fails, you'll need to supply the correct types yourself. If a column
specification created by cols(), it must contain one column specification
for each column. If you only want to read a subset of the columns, use
cols_only(). Alternatively, you can use a compact string representation
where each character represents one column: c = character, i = integer, n =
number, d = double, l = logical, f = factor, D = date, T = date time, t =
time, ? = guess, or _/- to skip the column.}
